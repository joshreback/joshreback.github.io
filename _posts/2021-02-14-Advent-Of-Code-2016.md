title: Advent of Code 2016
---

I've spent the past 1.5 months doing [AdventOfCode](adventofcode.com) (AoC) 2016 and comparing my solutions to [Peter Norvig's](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb). In this post, I want to outline my motivation for doing this, what I learned, and what's next.

<br/>


## Motivation

First off -- why do this? 

I've been programming in Python for a couple years now, and I feel like I write "journeyman" quality code. It gets the job done, but it feels clunky, inelegant, and imperative. At most smallish companies, the bar for shipping is whether the code gets the job done, so I've never really been forced to confront what I consider my low code quality.

Therefore, I wanted to set aside a good chunk of time to deliberately practice writing code. Not just banging out solutions to problems, but trying to understand the more nebulous aspects of what characterizes good code.

AoC seemed lke a perfect arena for this pursuit. It rewards the player with a gold star for each half problem solved (there are 25 problems released each year), so there is a steady diet of dopamine to stay engaged. But more seriously, the solutions to the AoC problems are challenging yet tractable. They're not impossible to solve, but they are sufficiently challenging that I would see a divergence between my code and that of someone who is expert-level. 

Comparing my solutions to those of a superior programmer confers multiple benefits. At a low level, it provides me a way to learn about new language features or idioms I'm not currently using or aware of. Reading somebody else's code can be a really effective way to remove your coding blinders. At a higher level, though, as mentioned above, I think "good code" is very much an inexact science; I believe there's a strong element of "you know it when you see it", therefore, it's important to see it!

## My Solution To A Problem

My methodology was as follows: first I would solve the problem, then I'd compare my solution to Norvig's. I did this for each of the 25 problems (each of which had two parts) for that year. I will simply hone in on one particular problem which seems pretty representative.

In Problem 2, available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2), we need to punch in a sequence of numbers onto a keypad. We start in the middle of the keypad, and are given a list of instructions which correspond to the keys to press. There are several lines, each line contains a sequence of directions (U/D/R/L), and the key you are on at the end of the line corresponds to the button to press. We are also told that moves that would lead us off the edge of the keypad are ignored.

Again, I'll just note that this is not a difficult coding question to solve. It's easier than a lot of coding interviews (although the AoC puzzles do ramp up in difficulty). The focus here shouldn't be "can I solve this" (although it still was for me, since I always tend to be in a rush) but rather "can I solve this elegantly".

My solution is below, followed by a list of gripes:
```
keypad = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]


def navigate(keypad, loc, move):
    row, col = loc
    move_dict = {
        "U": lambda row, col: (row - 1, col),
        "D": lambda row, col: (row + 1, col),
        "R": lambda row, col: (row, col + 1),
        "L": lambda row, col: (row, col - 1),
    }
    row, col = move_dict[move](row, col)
    if row < 0 or row >= len(keypad) or col < 0 or col >= len(keypad[row]):
        return loc  
    return (row, col)


def get_button(loc, line):
    for move in line:
        loc = navigate(loc, move)
    return loc


def get_code(instructions):
    loc = (1, 1)
    code = []
    instructions = instructions.split("\n")
    for line in instructions:
        loc = get_button(keypad, loc, list(line))
        row, col = loc
        code.append(keypad[row][col])
    return code


code = get_code(open("2_day_test_input.txt").read())
print(code)
```

There are several things I don't like about my solution right off the bat: 

1. The logic for checking whether a movement leads us off the edge of the key pad is just sort of bolted on in the navigate function. It seemed to me like t here should be an elegant way to handle that part of the problem, but what I have here does not feel elegant.

2. The code feels poorly abstracted. I tried to break it apart so that the top-level was assembling the code, that depends on getting each button-press, which in turn depends on navigating on each step. But unfortunately, it seems like you have to follow the thread from `get_code` to `get_button` to `navigate` to understand the solution. In other words, the solution does not present itself "at a glance".

3. I tend to write code by first initializing arrays, then iterating through a for-loop, and appending to the array. This is textbook imperative code, grossly revealing side effects and mutations. I am aware of a more functional style, where you yield results as they are generated (the paper entitled, "Why Functional Programming Matters", gives a great example of this pattern on page 9), but it has not become my default when writing programs.

## Comparing My Solution To An Expert's

Now let's look at Norvig's solution:
```

Keypad = str.split

keypad = Keypad("""
.....
.123.
.456.
.789.
.....
""")

assert keypad[2][2] == '5'

off = '.'

def decode(instructions, x=2, y=2):
    """Follow instructions, keeping track of x, y position, and
    yielding the key at the end of each line of instructions."""
    for line in instructions:
        for C in line:
            x, y = move(C, x, y)
        yield keypad[y][x]

def move(C, x, y):
    "Make the move corresponding to this character (L/R/U/D)"
    if   C == 'L' and keypad[y][x-1] is not off: x -= 1
    elif C == 'R' and keypad[y][x+1] is not off: x += 1
    elif C == 'U' and keypad[y-1][x] is not off: y -= 1
    elif C == 'D' and keypad[y+1][x] is not off: y += 1
    return x, y

assert move('U', 2, 2) == (2, 1)
assert move('U', 2, 1) == (2, 1)
assert cat(decode("ULL RRDDD LURDL UUUUD".split())) == '1985'

cat(decode(Input(2)))
```

This solution shines compared to mine in a number of ways:

1. There's no "bolted on" logic to deal with invalid key presses. There is some special checking, of course, but it's inlined with the other checks and feels like it fits more naturally. This flows from the fact that the keypad representation has the numbers padded by `off` characters. This representation allows for much more succinct logic.
2. This one is more cosmetic, but I think it's nice to be able to just look at the keypad variable and see it as a string, which plainly reveals its structure. This makes the solution very readable.
3. Whereas I pushed the logic for iterating over each character in a line into lower-functions, this solution has all the iteration at the top-level. This also, I feel, makes the solution readable. In my last post, I wrote about "Functional Core / Imperative Shell", and I somewhat think that iteration is a form of state. Therefore, instead of pushing that state down into what should be functional subcomponents, it should be kept out at the shell of the program.
4. The `move` function is a lot more compact and readable. This is more of a tactical advantage, but Norvig's reads directions to change `x` _or_ `y`, whereas my code considers _both_ `row` and `col` when reading directions. This is an example of how brevity and elegance go hand in hand.

## Reflecting on the Differences

This was just one problem of many, but there were a few themes in the handful of lines of code shown above that were prevalent across many problems:

* A well thought-out representation can help simplify edge-case handling
* "Leaf-level" functions are simpler and more functional.
* The mechanics of the solution are apparent from the "outer" layers of code.

It might seem that since there isn't much code to look at here, the learnings from this kind of reflection won't transfer to "real work". However, I do think there's a lot of overlap between writing good code and designing good systems. A well-written program and a well-designed system will both feature:

- loosely coupled components
- composability
- good abstraction

The aesthetic is the same, but the scale is different.

While not impossible, it's hard to practice designing large systems since the feedback loop is long. Therefore, putting small amounts of code under the microscope like this can help sharpen programming chops which I think will transfer beyond just solving puzzles.

## What's Next

More stars for sure, this is hard not to get addicted to:

So I'm going to keep going through these puzzles for more recent years.

But I also want to ratchet up the difficulty a bit, and go into more of a learning mode. After going through this exercise, I am very primed to understand from an expert about what techniques are available for writing good programs. So, my next goal is to complete Peter Norvig's "Design Of Computer Programs" class on Udacity.
